NeoNextion
==========

An Arduino library for the [Nextion](wiki.iteadstudio.com/Nextion_HMI_Solution)
line of displays.

The code is heavily based on the [official library](https://github.com/itead/ITEADLIB_Arduino_Nextion)
but aims to be cleaner, more user friendly and with a bit of luck, faster.
